# twilio-nodejs
This is very basic example of integration between [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) and NodeJs. Basically this small application is used to send SMS. 

## Installation

Clone or download zip to your machine then hit below command

    npm install
    
## Configuration
Change environmental variable i.e. account_sid, access_token, etc.. with your own credentials.

## Run
Hit below command to run the application
    node sendSms.js

## Notes
I have used dotnet module of nodejs to setup environment variable for security purpose.

## ToDo
+ Save twilio repsone to MongoDB 
+ Convert javascript code to support `async` 
+ Convert to support large number of message
