### twilio-nodejs
This is very basic example of integration between [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) and NodeJs. Basically this small application is used to send SMS. 

# Installation

Clone or download zip to your machine then hit below command

    npm install
    
# Configuration
Change environmental variable i.e. account_sid, access_token, etc.. with your own credentials.


# Notes
I have used dotnet module of nodejs to setup environment variable for security purpose.

# ToDo
+ Save twilio repsone to MongoDB 
+ Make this code using `async`
+ Convert to support large number of message
